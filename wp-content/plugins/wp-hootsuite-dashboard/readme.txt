A plugin that adds a gateway to the Admin Panel to use HootSuite directly through the backend of WordPress

== Description ==

**ATTENTION: You need to login to your account at the Hootsuite website first before you can use this plugin, otherwise, you will be redirected to their site.**

Social Media is a large part of marketing your business. However, with so many networking sites to work with, it can be a full time job, just keeping up with the contant flow of posts on your Facebook Page, Twitter account, Google Places page, LinkedIn, Youtube, and the list goes on. 

So many businesses or site Administrators use the wonderful tool Hootsuite to manage, schedule and collaborate their Social Media networks. This plugin now puts the power of HootSuite in the palm of your WordPress hand, by enabling an admin area gateway for your HootSuite account. You can now do all of your scheduling and posting directly from your WordPress dashboard. 

**You must have a HootSuite Account. There is a free level, which can be found here:** https://hootsuite.com/

There is no configuration needed. WP HootSuite Dashboard does allow for you to set permissions for the various user roles. So if you have users with limited site access to the backend, like editors, then you can allow or restrict their ability to view the WP HootSuite Dashboard.

Keep your eye out for the Pro Addon, which will include some very special front end features through the HootSuite API.

**WP HootSuite Dashboard plugin is developed by the team at Jagged Edge Media, an independent third party development company, and has no direct association, relation, or connection with HootSuite(TM) website services or the website.**
